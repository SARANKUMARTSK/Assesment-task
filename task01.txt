TASK 01 : Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol 
It is used in client-server communication
By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.
There are several stages of development of HTTP but we will focus mainly on HTTP/1.1 which was created in 1997 & the new one is HTTP/2 which was created in 2015.

Difference : 

HTTP/1.1 : It works on the textual format.
HTTP/2   : It works on the binary protocol.(HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. )

HTTP/1.1 : There is head of line blocking that blocks all the requests behind it until it doesnâ€™t get its all resources.
HTTP/2   : It allows multiplexing so one TCP connection is required for multiple requests.

HTTP/1.1 : It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages
HTTP/2   : It uses PUSH frame by server that collects all multiple pages 

HTTP/1.1 : It compresses data by itself
HTTP/2   : It uses HPACK for data compression
